              👋 Hi, I&apos;m Adam Lisner
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at FIT
              ČVUT 🎓, where I focus on Java, C/C++, algorithms, software
              design, and cybersecurity. My academic journey has been driven by
              a deep passion for building innovative, high-impact solutions that
              solve real-world problems 💡.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Alongside my studies, I work as a Student Software Developer at
              Commerzbank AG, working on Loan Evaluation Application 📈
              built with technologies such as Java 17, TypeScript, React, and
              OpenShift. This hands-on experience has sharpened my skills in
              enterprise development, cloud platforms, and modern
              frontend/backend architectures.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              When I'm not coding, I believe in a balanced life! You can often
              find me on the tennis court 🎾, out for a run 🏃‍♂️, or enjoying a
              great cup of coffee ☕️. I'm a
              collaborative team player and a reliable contributor who's always
              eager to learn and grow. I'm excited to apply my knowledge to new
              projects and play an active role in shaping the future of
              technology! 🚀
